C++ Lesson 1: Exercises

These are exercises for you to complete and then try out in the compiler.
You may want to look at the examples for this lesson as a starting point.


Exercises: Functions

Functions can take more than one argument.  Each argument has a type and a
name, and additional arguments are separated by commas.  So a function that
multiplies two numbers of type double could start like this:
     double multiply(double x, double y)

1. Implement the function multiply(). [Hint: look at square().]
2. Implement a function printMultiply() that, similar to printSquare(), will
   print the result of multiplying two numbers.
3. Write a new main() program that calls printMultiply() with a few different
   values, and run the program.


Exercise: Input and output

Similar to output with cout, you can read multiple values with cin by
stringing together multiple items with “>>”.
     double x, y;
     cin >> x >> y;

4. Update the main() function in Exercise 3 for printMultiply() so that the 
   user types in the values of x and y that are passed to printMultiply().
